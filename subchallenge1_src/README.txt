Put the networks in data/subchallenge1 folder.
We expect the following dependencies for the code to execute
MATLAB
the path of the matlab should be set so that it is directly accessible using matlab command from UNIX terminal

use python 2.7,python 3 might create issues
PYTHON
install package python-numpy, python-networkx

R 
install package WGCNA

for each network,go to the directory and run
bash 1.sh
bash 2.sh
bash 3.sh
bash 4.sh
bash 5.sh
bash 6.sh
